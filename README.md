Additionally Macro economic factors have been imported as an additional table for the purpose of running regression 

##Regression analysis
Regression has been run through R, by selecting variables based on literature review and combining features representing similar entropy, which was identified using covarience analysis. 

##Application implementation
Application is run through python based FLASK framework, using Google vis for interactive graphing.
